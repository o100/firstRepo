As you see from our prototype, we added few options for adding the recipient. 
Beside sending money directly to bank account or via the email, we added a telephone number and Facebook options.

Quantitative metrics:
	1. based on information from database, we would analyse which options (buttons) are used for successful 
		transfers;
	2. analysing unsuccessful transfers, we would find out which steps are the bottlenecks;
	3. by adding click counters for all options, the most popular/unpopular options could be 
		filtered out (includes AB testing);
	4. analysing the connection between the channel by which the customer finds TransferWise 
		and which option he or she uses for adding the recipient;
	5. measure the transfer speed and see which options (buttons) are the fastest.
	
Qualitative metrics:
	6. customer feedback (positive and negative);
